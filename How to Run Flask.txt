You need to have a virtual enviroment:

run: 
	pip install virtualenv
	note:	Make sure to have your terminal running as administrator, 
		if you don't it will be installed in the wrong place and be unsuable

When you are in the project folder (same folder that has static and templates) run:
	virtualenv venv

This creates a folder called venv, which defines your virtual environment

Now run:
	source venv/Scripts/activate
	Note: 	this is just source <path to the activate file in venv>, 
		venv/Scripts/activate is what is was for me, it was /env/bin/activate in the tutorial
	Note for Window: You may need to setup Python virtual enviroment on Windows. To do it, following these:
		Running PowerShell as administrator: On the search bar of window, search: Windows PowerShell -> right click -> run as administrator
		Activate the virtual environment:
			Running these two commands to set executionplolicy unrestricted
				> cd~
				> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force 
			Activate environment: (**in window we use "\", not"/")
				cd to venv folder
				>.\Scripts\activate 


you should now have (venv) at the beginning of your terminal path

Run:
	pip install Flask

Then:
	flask run
	Note: Make sure you are running "flask run" in folder that contain app.py (Mine is Capstone-Summer-Fall folder).
		If you are not in folder that contain app.py, it will promp: "app.py" module was not found in the current directory.

The output should tell you where the flask app is being run, but it should be:
	http://127.0.0.1:5000
