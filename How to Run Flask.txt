You need to have a virtual enviroment:

run: 
	pip install virtualenv
	note:	Make sure to have your terminal running as administrator, 
		if you don't it will be installed in the wrong place and be unsuable

When you are in the project folder (same folder that has static and templates) run:
	virtualenv venv

This creates a folder called venv, which defines your virtual environment

Now run:
	source venv/Scripts/activate
	Note: 	this is just source <path to the activate file in venv>, 
		venv/Scripts/activate is what is was for me, it was /env/bin/activate in the tutorial

you should now have (venv) at the beginning of your terminal path

Run:
	pip install Flask

Then:
	flask run

The output should tell you where the flask app is being run, but it should be:
	http://127.0.0.1:5000
