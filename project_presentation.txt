Ranking

First:	(8) Glass Plate Game (Bart Massey): Web-app game? I know nothing about this game, but I think we can do it. 

Second: (1)InstaServ: Is this a web-app?? We know exactly what we need to do. If we choose this project, we just jump in to do project. Looks like the already have user interface design for us. What language will we work with if we do this project? html, css, javascript, creactjs, node.js???

Third: (9) SightLine: I have no knowlegde about this field. But the project is interesting and looks like it's not more complicate than others projects.

Fourth:(2)knowledge graph generator: She already has some source for us like open-source NLP, spacy.io. We know clearly how the product should be. It may not hard like other projects. But I don't know, the problems will come when we really work on project.

Fifth; (4)Smart Cozy: This is a continouation of the previous project. => I don't really like it. In my understanding, we will create some more games for this Smart Cozy device, but the games of this device are not simmilar like other small games we have seen on websites. They dont' tell how many games we need to do.

Sixth: (5) Open Data Stream: Work in backend, sql??? What is our product??
