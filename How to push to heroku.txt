Download the heroku CLI
	Note: 	everything done in the heroku CLI must be done from the terminal command line
		this means that you can't log in to heroku from gitbash 

Also download gunicorn with:
	pip install gunicorn
In the terminal:
	heroku login -i
	Then login with your heroku account info (if you don't have a heroku account linked to our project, talk to Travis)

Set your local files to go through git to be able to be pushed to heroku with:
	heroku git:remote -a capstoneteamc

Then push what's in your local files on the main branch with:
	git push heroku main
	Note: your local files will have to match up with what's in the git repository

You can instead push a branch with:
	git push heroku {testbranch}:main
	replacing {testbranch} with the branch you want to push
